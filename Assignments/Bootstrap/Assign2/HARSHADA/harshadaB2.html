                 When they are captured, they can live longer than 20 years.
                 In the wild, males do not usually live longer than 10 years.
                 This is because wounds from fighting with other males make their lives shorter.
                 They usually live in savanna and grassland.
                 These areas do have bushes and trees, but lions are mainly adapted to catch prey on grasslands.
                 Compared to other cats, lions are social. A group of lions is called a pride. 
                 In a pride of lions, there are related females, their young, and one or two adult males.
                 Groups of female lions often hunt together.

      After leaving STEC India in May, 2013, it was time to reboot KQI. KQI is now AmberSoft.

      This time it will be a product company. We are developing a product for optimizing various business operations. First business operation that we are targeting is recruitment. We already have a beta version of software that we are using to manage recruitment for a set of clients and it is already showing significant improvement in hiring. 
      And as usual, it is fun Building Team, Build Product.

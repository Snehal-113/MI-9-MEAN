            Art refers to a diverse range of human activities in creating visual,
            auditory or performing artifacts. These artworks express the author's
            imaginative or technical skill. Art is intended to be appreciated for its beauty
            or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the
            production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art,
            and the aesthetic dissemination of art.

            The oldest form of art are visual arts, which include creation of images or
            objects in fields including painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography, and
            other visual media. Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts;
            however, like the decorative arts, it involves the creation of objects where
            the practical considerations of use are essential,
            in a way that they usually are not in a painting, for example.

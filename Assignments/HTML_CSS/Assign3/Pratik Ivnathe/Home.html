        The mountains, which appear to us so gigantic, are really, compared to the size of the earth, only small irregularities on the earth’s surface. They have been compared to the wrinkles on the rind of an orange. All mountains and hills are formed of hard rock, otherwise they would long ago have been leveled to flat plains.

The great ranges were probably formed when the sub­stance of the earth, which was once molten, was cooling; but their shape and size have been much modified during the ages by the action of water, frost and volcanic force.

Ruskin has pointed out that mountains are of the greatest possible use to man in three ways in connection with air, water and earth.

The mountains have a great deal to do with keeping the air circulating, and renewing its purity. The snow-covered summits of high mountains make the air in contact with them very cold; and as cold air tends to sink.

It descends to the plains and lowlands in cooling winds; while the hot air of the plains rises up to the higher altitudes to be cooled and descend purified again to the lower levels.

The air can, therefore, never remain stagnant in one place, but is always moving and being refreshed by the cool rocks and snows of the mountains.

Mountains, again, are the great reservoirs of the earth’s fresh water, and are the source of the rivers and streams, without which men could not live. They catch the rain and store it up, in the following way. Warm moisture-la
